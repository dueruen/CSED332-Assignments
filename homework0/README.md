**You find a piece of code on the web. You copy it into IntelliJ IDEA but the formatting is off. Using IntelliJ IDEA shortcuts, how would you change the unformatted text.**  
I'm using Ubuntu, and on Ubuntu the IntelliJ shortcut to auto format code is: 
<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>WINDOWS</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>

**Sometimes you would like to quickly comment/uncomment a chunk of code. How would you do this (i.e., what keyboard shortcut would you use) in IntelliJ IDEA without having to manually manipulate each line?**  
The official shortcut to do comment/uncomment is:  
<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd>  
but the `/` is the one on the NumPad. I have therfore rebinde the shortcut to be:  
<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>7</kbd>

**Keyboard shortcuts are useful when you are editing Java code. One very useful keyboard shortcut is <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>. What does it do?**  
If this shortcut is used when a classname is highlighted it is possible to go to the subclasses of is superclass. If there is no subclasses it can not jump. If there a only on subclass it will jump directly to that subclass. And if there a more than one subclass a list will be prompted where it is possible to select the subclass to jump to.
